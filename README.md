# Lab-05-First-Semester-FAST-NUCES-encypting-decrypting-a-letter-with-a-key-provided-by-user

We were given a task in Lab 05 of Semester 1 at FAST NUCES, where we had to take input from the user to determine whether they wanted to encrypt or decrypt a letter. Next, we needed to input the key, and based on the user's choice, we either encrypted or decrypted the letter using that key.

Question: Write a program that uses bitwise operators to perform encryption and decryption of a
character.

I used the bitwise XOR (^) operator to complete this task, where I simply applied XOR between the character entered by the user and the key provided.
